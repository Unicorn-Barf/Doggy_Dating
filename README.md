## Description

Arrrrf you found us!  Bone Buddies is the ultimate web application to discover and interact with other dog lovers emphasizing the importance of finding the ideal dog playmate for your dog.  Our site will easily guide you through the process of creating an account and then setting up your dog's profile.  And because we love dogs so much... of course!  You can make as many dog profile per account as you need since we all now you can't have too many.  We took a unique approach in keeping the application experience dog-centric in order to quickly assess the compatibility of possible dog-mates so that no time is wasted on social niceties with other humans until you find the dog match that was made in heaven.  From there, the owners can take over and communicate via chat to make plans for Rover and Fido to romp through some ocean waves or chase their favorite ball.

Bone Buddies is a MERN stack application integrated with an Apollo server.  This provides the flexibility to quickly innovate and improve the user experience; the team has plans to grow the functionality and features to keep humans and canines happy and thriving.  Apollo subscriptions were chosen to deliver responsive websocket features so you will never miss a message or moment with live data automatically coming to life on the screen.  Cloudinary hosts any uploaded profile pictures so that you can rely on easily adding your favorite friend's adorable, clumsy, and impressive moments to attract the perfect playmate.

## What we Learned

This was the first time that this team implemented websockets using Apollo subscriptions to get live date shared between users.  There are some notable differences beween using Apollo subscriptions vs other options such as SocketIO.  One thing to note, Apollo docs show a setup for a websocket client being served with a `ws://` protocol.  With SocketIO the default protocol is over https and wss; the problem that arises is that deployment on Heroku becomes an issue.  We found a simple solution shown below to set up your `wsLink` in the main index.js of a npx `create-react-app`.  Using this setup, it not only get around the issue of the `wss` protocol for production, but and sets the appropriate development websocket link.


```js
// Apollo Subscriptions setup
let wsLink;
// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globals
if (/herokuapp/g.test(location.host)) {
    wsLink = new GraphQLWsLink(createClient({
        // eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-globals
        url: `wss://${location.host}/graphql`,
      }));
} else {
    wsLink = new GraphQLWsLink(createClient({
        url: `ws://localhost:3001/graphql`,
      }));
}
```

The next thing that one needs to keep in mind when setting up for utilizing subscriptions, keep in mind the difference between the apollo hooks, `useQuery()` and `useSubscription()`.  We found the best strategy for our application was to use `useQuery()` because if you check documentation, there is a way to query and attach a subscription to dynamically update that query data through websockets as the database get hit and triggers different PubSub events.  Below is an example of how to `.subscribeToMore()` on an existing query:

```js
  const convoQuery = useQuery(GET_CONVERSATION_BY_ID,
    { variables: { conversationId } });

  // Handle subscription for messages
  convoQuery.subscribeToMore({
    document: GET_MESSAGES_SUB,
    variables: { conversationId },
    updateQuery: (prev, { subscriptionData }) => {
      if (!subscriptionData.data) return prev;
      const messages = subscriptionData.data.messageSent.messages;
      return {
        getConversationById: [...messages],
      };
    }
  });
```

As seen above, `subscribeToMore()` is a function that belongs to the return object from `useQuery()` that can configure how to handle subscriptions related to the data that you querried for.  The data structures you query for and pass to update have some specific constraints to be wary of, read the Apollo docs carefully because they accurrately explain if.  If you have data structures set up incorrectly, the errors are not very descriptive and can be very hard to trace.  One of the most interesting parts of the `.subscribeToMore()` is the `updateQuery()` hook that handles how to update the user's data depending on what subscription data is returned from the websocket subscription.  Once again, follow docs carefully so you can guarantee it is the correct structure.

On the backend, behind the scenes, there are events and listeners on the server level to appropriately direct traffic and manage which clients get what data.  A fun but necessary feature we implemented on the backend was filtering on pubsub events.  Below shows what a serverside subscription resolver looks like in our case handling a new message sent event:

```js
messageSent: {
      subscribe: withFilter(
         () => pubsub.asyncIterator(['NEW_MESSAGE']),
         (payload, variables) => {
            // Only push update for relevent Dogs
            return (payload.messageSent._id.toString() === variables.conversationId);
         }
      )
   },
   ```

   As you can see, we can use the `withFilter()` to help decide which clients get send the data.  This function takes a normal event asyncIterator from pubsub, and a callback function that should return `true` to send the data or `false` it data shouldn't be sent to the subscriber.  We simply checked the subscriber's converstaion id against the `NEW_MESSAGE` event's conversation id to route to the appropriate users.

This project provides a great simple template to see how you can implement Apollo Subscriptions on a MERN stack to create a simple chat app.  We are excited to refine the usage while weaving in new features to breath life into the UX.
